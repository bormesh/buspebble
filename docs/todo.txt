Rob's work in progress
======================

*   After logging out, erase the raw_password setting.

*   Do the rest of the stuff in the `Authentication`_ section.

*   Figure out how to highlight the nav link to the currently viewed
    page.

    For example if we're on /#weekly-manifests, highlight that link in
    the navbar by setting the CSS class "active".

    This is one way to look up the current ID, but there's likely a more
    elegant approach:

        pager.activePage$().getId()

Metric's
========
*   I'd like to capture the following Metric's:

    *   Longest wait time for a given stop
    *   Average wait times for each stop
    *   ? Are rush hour buses generally slower?
    *   How does the day affect the metric?

*   Make chart's for the above metric -- I think that
    would help to illustrate how powerful the data is

*   Talk about other things we might want to measure

    *   Some routes have later predicted times and then come back to
    schedule -- that's a good metric for how well we're actually able
    to predict

    *   This is just a weeks worth of data -- what metrics could we
    capture over weeks?

    *   If a bus is consistently over it's scheduled time, what does
        that say about the scheduled time?
